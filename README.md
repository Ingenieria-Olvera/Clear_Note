# Clear_Note

### Your productivity monster
I have ran into problems of always wanting to learn or write down quick notes, yet I have found it very inconvient to carry my own pen and paper to write things down. And every time I would write something in my phone I would get distracted and forget what I was trying to write down in the first place. Which led me to want to build my own device that would solve the distraction aspects of phones by being very minamalistic while also being convienet like a pen and paper. Which led me to design Clear note.
The form factor is heavily designed by the brilliant [Ashtf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf3BxNq1cp4&list=PLTp63iou1QwVIQdRVYZMRFWzoxn4KbLYZ&index=31) and his project of his own productivty tool (which is absolutley brilliant). While was also inspired by the Galaxy Note series for the ability to draw percise notes on screens, IPod for the simple download and listen music functionality, and DSI for the form and UI.
